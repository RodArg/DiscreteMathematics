            	<p>
		Counting problems arise throughout mathematics and computer science.<br>
		Examples:<br>
                        1. The successful outcomes of experiments.<br>
                        2. The number of operations used by an algorithm to study its Time Complexity.<br>

						<details>
							<summary class="sum4">
							Answer:
							</summary>
							<p>
							The procedure of labeling a chair consists of two tasks, namely, assigning to the seat one of the 26 uppercase English letters, and then assigning to it one of the 100 possible integers. The product rule shows that there are <b>26 * 100 = 2600 </b>different ways that a chair can be labeled. Therefore, the largest number of chairs that can be labeled differently is <b>2600 </b>.

							There are <b>26 </b>choices for each of the three uppercase English letters and ten choices for each of the three digits. Hence, by the product rule there are a total of <b>26 * 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 17,576,000 </b>possible license plates.

							Answer:

							<p>
							The student can choose a project by selecting a project from the first list, the second list, or the third list. Because no project is on more than one list, by the sum rule there are <b>23 + 15 + 19 = 57 </b>ways to choose a project.

							<summary class="sum4">
							Answer:
							</summary>
							<p>
							The initial value of k is zero. This block of code is made up of m different loops. Each time a loop is traversed, 1 is added to k. To determine the value of k after this code has been executed, we need to determine how many times we traverse a loop. Note that there are n <sub>i</sub> ways to traverse the ith loop. Because we only traverse one loop at a time, the sum rule shows that the final value of k, which is the number of ways to traverse one of the m loops is <b>n<sub>1</sub>+ n <sub>2</sub> + ... + n <sub>m</sub></b> .

			<p>
			<b>Example:</b><br>
			Each user on a computer system has a password, which is six to eight characters long, where each character is an uppercase letter or a digit. Each password must contain at least one digit. How many possible passwords are there?
			</p>

			<details>
				<summary class="sum3">
				Answer:
				</summary>
				<p>
				Let P be the total number of possible passwords, and let P<sub>6</sub> , P<sub>7</sub> , and P<sub>8</sub> denote the number of possible passwords of length 6, 7, and 8, respectively. <br>By the sum rule, <b>P = P<sub>6</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>8</sub> </b>. <br>We will now find P<sub>6</sub> , P<sub>7</sub> , and P<sub>8</sub> . <br>Finding P<sub>6</sub> directly is difficult. To find P<sub>6</sub>  it is easier to find the number of strings of uppercase letters and digits that are six characters long, including those with no digits, and subtract from this the number of strings with no digits. By the product rule, the number of strings of six characters is 36<sup>6</sup>, and the number of strings with no digits is 26<sup>6</sup>. Hence,<br>

P<sub>6</sub> = 36<sup>6</sup> - 26<sup>6</sup> = 2,176,782,336 - 308,915,776 = 1,867,866,560.<br>
Similarly, we have<br>
P<sub>7</sub> = 36<sup>7</sup> - 26<sup>7</sup> = 78,364,164,096 - 8,031,810,176 = 70,332,353,920<br>
and<br>
P<sub>8</sub> = 36<sup>8</sup> - 26<sup>8</sup> = 2,821,109,907,456 - 208,827,064,576 = 2,612,282,842,880.<br>
<b>P = P<sub>6</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>8</sub> = 2,684,483,063,360.</b><br>

			<b>Example:</b><br>
			</p>
			<p>
			A computer company receives 350 applications from computer graduates for a job planning a line of new Web servers. Suppose that 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in business, and 51 majored both in computer science and in business. How many of these applicants majored neither in computer science nor in business?
			</p>	
					<details>
						<summary class="sum3">
						Answer:
						</summary>

					<p>
					To find the number of these applicants who majored neither in computer science nor in business, we can subtract the number of students who majored either in computer science or in business (or both) from the total number of applicants. Let A 1 be the set of students who majored in computer science and A 2 the set of students who majored in business. Then A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> is the set of students who majored in computer science or business (or both), and A 1 &cap; A 2 is the set of students who majored both in computer science and in business. By the subtraction rule the number of students who majored either in computer science or in business (or both) equals<br>

<b>|A 1 &cup; A 2 | = |A 1 | + |A 2 | - |A 1 &cap; A 2 | = 220 + 147 - 51 = 316.</b><br>
We conclude that <b> 350 - 316 = 34 </b> of the applicants majored neither in computer science nor in business.
