                            A <b>set</b> is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a ̸∈ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.
                        </p>
                            <p>

                            There are two ways of describing, or specifying the members of, a set
                            <br>
                            Two Ways are :
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                <b>Roster method:</b> refers to a technique in representing a set by directly listing all of its elements, which are separated by commas and enclosed by a pair of curly brackets.
                                <br>
                                Example: The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet can be written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <b>Set builder:</b> We characterize all those elements in the set by stating the property or properties they must have to be members. 
                                <br>
                                For instance, the set O of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be written as
                                O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}
                                or, specifying the universe as the set of positive integers, as
                                O={x∈<b>Z+</b>|xisodd andx< 10}.
                                <br>
                                We often use this type of notation to describe sets when it is impossible to list all the elements
                                of the set. For instance, the set <b>Q+</b> of all positive rational numbers can be written as
                                <br>
                                <b>Q+</b>={x∈<b>R</b>|x=p, for some positive integers p and q}.
                                <br>
                                These sets, each denoted using a boldface letter, play an important role in discrete mathematics:

The relative complement of B in A (also called the set-theoretic difference of A and B), denoted by A \ B (or A − B), is the set of all elements that are members of A but not members of B. Note that it is valid to "subtract" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element green from the set {1, 2, 3}; doing so has no effect.
