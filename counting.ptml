							Answer:
							</summary>
							<p>
							The procedure of labeling a chair consists of two tasks, namely, assigning to the seat one of the 26 uppercase English letters, and then assigning to it one of the 100 possible integers. The product rule shows that there are <b>26 * 100 = 2600 </b>different ways that a chair can be labeled. Therefore, the largest number of chairs that can be labeled differently is <b>2600 </b>.

							The student can choose a project by selecting a project from the first list, the second list, or the third list. Because no project is on more than one list, by the sum rule there are <b>23 + 15 + 19 = 57 </b>ways to choose a project.

						<details>
							<summary class="sum4">
							Answer:
							</summary>
							<p>
							The initial value of k is zero. This block of code is made up of m different loops. Each time a loop is traversed, 1 is added to k. To determine the value of k after this code has been executed, we need to determine how many times we traverse a loop. Note that there are n <sub>i</sub> ways to traverse the ith loop. Because we only traverse one loop at a time, the sum rule shows that the final value of k, which is the number of ways to traverse one of the m loops is <b>n<sub>1</sub>+ n <sub>2</sub> + ... + n <sub>m</sub></b> .

			<b>Example:</b><br>
			Each user on a computer system has a password, which is six to eight characters long, where each character is an uppercase letter or a digit. Each password must contain at least one digit. How many possible passwords are there?
			</p>

			<details>
				<summary class="sum3">
				Answer:
				</summary>
				<p>
				Let P be the total number of possible passwords, and let P<sub>6</sub> , P<sub>7</sub> , and P<sub>8</sub> denote the number of possible passwords of length 6, 7, and 8, respectively. <br>By the sum rule, <b>P = P<sub>6</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>8</sub> </b>. <br>We will now find P<sub>6</sub> , P<sub>7</sub> , and P<sub>8</sub> . <br>Finding P<sub>6</sub> directly is difficult. To find P<sub>6</sub>  it is easier to find the number of strings of uppercase letters and digits that are six characters long, including those with no digits, and subtract from this the number of strings with no digits. By the product rule, the number of strings of six characters is 36<sup>6</sup>, and the number of strings with no digits is 26<sup>6</sup>. Hence,<br>

P<sub>6</sub> = 36<sup>6</sup> - 26<sup>6</sup> = 2,176,782,336 - 308,915,776 = 1,867,866,560.<br>
Similarly, we have<br>
P<sub>7</sub> = 36<sup>7</sup> - 26<sup>7</sup> = 78,364,164,096 - 8,031,810,176 = 70,332,353,920<br>
and<br>
P<sub>8</sub> = 36<sup>8</sup> - 26<sup>8</sup> = 2,821,109,907,456 - 208,827,064,576 = 2,612,282,842,880.<br>
<b>P = P<sub>6</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>8</sub> = 2,684,483,063,360.</b><br>

			A computer company receives 350 applications from computer graduates for a job planning a line of new Web servers. Suppose that 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in business, and 51 majored both in computer science and in business. How many of these applicants majored neither in computer science nor in business?
			<br>
			</p>	
					<details>
						<summary class="sum3">
						Answer:

					<p>
					To find the number of these applicants who majored neither in computer science nor in business, we can subtract the number of students who majored either in computer science or in business (or both) from the total number of applicants. Let A 1 be the set of students who majored in computer science and A 2 the set of students who majored in business. Then A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> is the set of students who majored in computer science or business (or both), and A 1 &cap; A 2 is the set of students who majored both in computer science and in business. By the subtraction rule the number of students who majored either in computer science or in business (or both) equals<br>

<b>|A 1 &cup; A 2 | = |A 1 | + |A 2 | - |A 1 &cap; A 2 | = 220 + 147 - 51 = 316.</b><br>
We conclude that <b> 350 - 316 = 34 </b> of the applicants majored neither in computer science nor in business.

					<details>
						<summary class="sum3">
						Answer:
						</summary>

					<p>
					We arbitrarily select a seat at the table and label it seat 1. We number the rest of the seats in numerical order, proceeding clockwise around the table. Note that are four ways to select the person for seat 1, three ways to select the person for seat 2, two ways to select the person for seat 3, and one way to select the person for seat 4. Thus, there are <b>4! = 24 </b>ways to order the given four people for these seats. However, each of the four choices for seat 1 leads to the same arrangement, as we distinguish two arrangements only when one of the people has a different immediate left or immediate right neighbor. Because there are four ways to choose the person for seat 1, by the division rule there are <b>24/4 = 6 </b>different seating arrangements of four people around the circular table.<br>

The pigeonhole principle states that there must be at least two objects in the same box when there are more objects than boxes. However, even more can be said when the number of objects exceeds a multiple of the number of boxes. For instance, among any set of 21 decimal digits there must be 3 that are the same.

					The minimum number of students needed to ensure that at least six students receive the same grade is the smallest integer N such that N/5 = 6. The smallest such integer is <b>N = 5 * 5 + 1 = 26</b>. If you have only 25 students, it is possible for there to be five who have received each grade so that no six students have received the same grade. Thus, 26 is the minimum number of students needed to ensure that at least six students will receive the same grade.

					Let a<sub>j</sub> be the number of games played on or before the jth day of the month. Then a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub> , . . . , a<sub>30</sub> is an increasing sequence of distinct positive integers, with 1 &le; a<sub>j</sub> &le; 45.<br>
More-over, a<sub>1</sub> + 14, a<sub>2</sub> + 14, . . . , a<sub>30</sub> + 14 is also an increasing sequence of distinct positive integers, with 15 &le; a<sub>j</sub> + 14 &le; 59.<br>
The 60 positive integers a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub> , . . . , a<sub>30</sub> , a<sub>1</sub> + 14, a<sub>2</sub> + 14, . . . , a<sub>30</sub> + 14 are all less than or equal to 59.<br>

Because the integers a<sub>j</sub> , j = 1, 2, . . . , 30 are all distinct and the integers a<sub>j</sub> + 14, j = 1, 2, . . . , 30 are all distinct, there must be indices i and j with a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>j</sub> + 14. This means that exactly 14 games were played from day j + 1 to day i.
