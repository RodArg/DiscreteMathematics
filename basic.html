                            A <b>set</b> is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a ̸∈ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.
                        </p>
                            <p>

                            There are two ways of describing, or specifying the members of, a set
                            <br>
                            Two Ways are :
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                <b>Roster method:</b> refers to a technique in representing a set by directly listing all of its elements, which are separated by commas and enclosed by a pair of curly brackets.
                                <br>
                                Example: The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet can be written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <b>Set builder:</b> We characterize all those elements in the set by stating the property or properties they must have to be members. 
                                <br>
                                For instance, the set O of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be written as
                                O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}
                                or, specifying the universe as the set of positive integers, as
                                O={x∈<b>Z+</b>|xisodd andx< 10}.
                                <br>
                                We often use this type of notation to describe sets when it is impossible to list all the elements
                                of the set. For instance, the set <b>Q+</b> of all positive rational numbers can be written as
                                <br>
                                <b>Q+</b>={x∈<b>R</b>|x=p, for some positive integers p and q}.
                                <br>
                                These sets, each denoted using a boldface letter, play an important role in discrete mathematics:
                                <br>

                            Given a set S, the <b>power set</b> of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P(S).

                            If S is the set {x, y, z}, then the subsets of S are
