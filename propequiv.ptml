            <p>
                An important type of step used in a mathematical argument is
                the replacement of a statement with another statement with the
                same truth value. Because of this, methods that produce
                propositions with the same truth value as a given compound
                proposition are used extensively in the construction of
                mathematical arguments.

            <p>
                A compound proposition that is always true, no matter what the
                truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it,
                is called a <i>tautology</i>.
                A compound proposition that is always
                false is called a <i>contradiction</i>.
                A compound proposition that is
                neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a
                <i>contingency</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Examples</b>:
                <br />
                "It is either raining or it is not raining" is 
                a <i>tautology</i>: it is always true.
                <br />
                "It is both raining and not raining" is a
                <i>contradiction</i>. It cannot ever be true.
                <br />
                "It is raining and the sun is out" is a
                <i>contingency</i>: it might be true, or might not.

                Compound propositions that have the same truth values in all
                possible cases are called <b>logically equivalent</b>.
