            <p>
                Quantification expresses the extent to which a predicate is
                true over a range of elements.
                We will focus on two types of quantification here: universal
                quantification, which tells us that a predicate is true for
                every element under consideration, and existential
                quantification, which tells us that there is one or more
                element under consideration for which the predicate is true.
